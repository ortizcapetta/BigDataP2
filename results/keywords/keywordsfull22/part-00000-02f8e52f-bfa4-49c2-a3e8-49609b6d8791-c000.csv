Yes...it was free at work and I'd never had one...nor had I ever had the flu before until last February...never want that bastard again. I know it's not 100% effective but a reduced chance or milder flu version is preferable to praying for death.
I’m 63 years old  and up until 3 years ago  I never had a flu shot.  I got the flu a couple times during those years but pulled thru ok.  But with age comes a greater risk so I’ll get one from now on
