I had two of your pillows.  They were horrible and we burned them.  Woke up with a headache every day using your product.
Don't be sorry. That's exactly what happened to me! I had my flu jab and got a chest infection - I'm still coughing 3 weeks later but had to take my meds because a cough is easier than a flare up. I feel you ‚ù§
