Reminds me an old story  it was my 1st winter in Europe and I got really sick  fever  cough  flu  sour throat. My housemate called a taxi and took me to the doctor. Instead of giving me medicines doctor recommended fresh orange juice &amp; lime water  some Vicks type candies etc.

I totally agree with you I mean I hope  pay their undivided attention to it and get our security forces what is best for them. having MRE on the missions specially for 3 to 4 days missions is less headache and there’s no need for wood gas or anything else..
