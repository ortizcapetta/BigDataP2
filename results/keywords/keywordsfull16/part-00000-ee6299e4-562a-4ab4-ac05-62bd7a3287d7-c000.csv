Strep and flu have same symptoms. I had those symptoms along with loss of appetite  always fucking sleeping  fever  and lost my voice mostly... doc said I tested positive for strep and tested negative for flu. I was like how.... my throat didn’t hurt. Lol but had everything else.
na minha opiniao o abad nao tem q sofrer o impeachment sla ele nao robo ninguem e ele tenta ajuda o nosso flu seria um golpe enorme quere impechma ele sla so acho justo e vc  ?
No shit. A noisy brew/pub is one thing but when I’m paying $50 a plate I’m expecting to at least talk to the table without having to yell or walk out with a headache.
Benching headache! Which one to bench from Wilson (HUD) Fraser (HUD) Anderson (CAR) Arnautovic (CAR) ?  (others are Richarlison (NEW) Sane (wat) Sterling (wat) Kane (SOU) but they're out of consideration!)
